Currently, I am an AI/ML Engineer at GSK. I apply machine learning techniques to answer biological questions, and investigate how statistical methods adapt to biological data.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ). I completed my PhD in computational biology at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Benjamin Haibe-Kains and Trevor Pugh.
